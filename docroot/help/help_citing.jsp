    <h2>Citing DataShop and Datasets</h2>
    
    <p>You can find dataset-specific citation guidance on the Citation page (<strong>Dataset Info &gt; 
    Citation</strong>) in DataShop or in the text file included with each export of data. This information 
    is taken from the <strong>Dataset Info</strong> 
    fields "Acknowledgement for Secondary Analysis" and "Preferred Citation for Secondary Analysis",
    which are settable by researchers who have edit access to the dataset. General citation guidance
    is given below.</p> 
    
    <p><strong>To cite the DataShop web application and repository:</strong></p>
    <p>Please include the following reference in your publication:</p>

    <p><strong>To cite a dataset for secondary analysis:</strong></p>
    <p>First determine if a citation or acknowledgement is given for the dataset you are using. 
    You can find dataset-specific citation guidance on the Citation page (<strong>Dataset Info &gt; 
    Citation</strong>) in DataShop.</p>

    <p>If no citation or acknowledgement is shown there, you will need to determine a primary paper
    for the dataset to reference. A primary paper is an article published by the owner of the dataset
    containing their analysis. Many datasets will have such a paper attached to the dataset under the <a
        href="help?page=files">Files</a> tab. If you're not sure which paper the
    primary researcher(s) would like to have cited (or if no paper is listed), <a
        href="help?page=contact">contact us</a> and we will put you in touch with them or determine an
    appropriate paper for citing.</p>

    <p>To cite a dataset for secondary analysis that does not have an owner, preferred citation, or
    acknowledgement (for example, a "course" dataset collected over the duration of a school year),
    determine an appropriate "global" paper for the domain. For example, to reference a mathematics
    course dataset, you could cite a recent book chapter on Cognitive Tutors.</p>
