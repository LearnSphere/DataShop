    <h2>Getting Data In</h2>
    
    <p>The best method for getting your data into DataShop depends on the state of your project.</p>
    
    <p>If you are developing a course or study and have not yet collected data, then you probably
    want to log student-tutor transactions as they occur. The page <a href="help?page=logging">Logging New Data</a> 
    describes a number of scenarios where you would log data from your course or study
    to DataShop.</p>
    
    <p>If you are interested in viewing data from a course or study that has
    occurred in the past, then you probably want to import the existing data. The page <a
    href="help?page=import">Importing New Data</a> describes the two main types of data 
    that can be imported into DataShop: XML files and tab-delimited text files.</p>
