	<h2>Reports</h2>
	<p>One of DataShop's main functions is that of a reporting tool.
	Researchers have access to both a set of standard reports,
	including most prominently learning curves, and to views of the data at
	various levels of abstraction, down to the granularity at which the
	data were originally logged.</p>
	<p>The reports currently available are:</p>
	<ul class="concise">
		<li><a href="help?page=datasetInfo">Dataset Info</a></li>
                <li><a href="help?page=perfProfiler">Performance Profiler</a></li>
		<li><a href="help?page=learningCurve">Learning Curve</a></li>
		<li><a href="help?page=errorReport">Error Report</a></li>
	</ul>
	<div class="clearFloat"></div>
