    <h2>IRB and Data Shareability</h2>
    
    <h3>Requirements for all projects</h3>
    
    <p>When you add a dataset to DataShop, you must complete the following steps on the IRB sub-tab
    of your project page. These requirements, specified in the latest IRB for DataShop, apply to 
    all datasets added to DataShop after April 2012.</p> 
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Specify the "data collection type"</strong>, which describes what type of IRB 
        (if any) applies to the data. The three options are:
        <ul class="concise" style="margin-top:1em">
            <li><strong>Not human subjects data (not originally collected for research purposes)</strong> 
            This includes data from a private company, which has no IRB governing how data can be 
            collected and shared.</li>
            <li><strong>Study data collected under an IRB where consent was not required (IRB approval 
            letter required)</strong> This is human subjects data. Please upload the IRB approval letter.</li>
            <li><strong>Study data collected under an IRB where consent was required (IRB approval letter 
            and consent form required)</strong> This is human subjects data. Please upload the IRB approval 
            letter and consent form to DataShop so that we have these on file.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Upload IRB documentation to the project</strong>, if the data was collected under an IRB.</li>
    </ol>    
    
    <h3>Additional requirement for projects where you would like to share your data with others</h3>

    <p>If you would also like to share the data in your project with others outside of your immediate 
    research team, you will need to complete steps 1 and 2 as described above, as well as an additional 
    step 3 (see below).  On the IRB sub-tab of your project page:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Specify the "data collection type"</strong>, described above</li>
        <li><strong>Upload IRB documentation to the project</strong>, if the data was collected under an IRB.</li>
        <li><strong>Submit the project for a review of its "shareability"</strong> by clicking "Submit project 
        for review". The research manager will review your project and respond either through email or DataShop.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>What constitutes "shareable"?</h3>
    
    <p>Data is shareable if it is not human subjects data, or if it human subjects data obtained under an 
    IRB that provides that the data may be shared. Data must also be de-identified (the identity of 
    subjects is not knowable from the data).</p>
    
    <p>DataShop's IRB dictates that some data cannot be shared. Data falling in this not-shareable category:</p>
    
    <ul class="concise">
        <li>data from research in which the consent form explicitly states that data collected will not be shared</li>
        <li>data from research in which it is unclear if data can be shared</li>
        <li>data from projects where the required IRB documentation is missing</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you have any questions about this process or what constitutes shareable data, please contact the 
    <a href="mailto:ds-research-manager@lists.andrew.cmu.edu">DataShop research manager</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Note that as long as your data is de-identified, you may import it. But we ask that you refrain 
    from using DataShop to share the data outside of your research team or make the data public until 
    you have gone through steps 1-3 above and received notice that your data may be shared.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Data added to DataShop prior to April 20, 2012 is not subject 
    to these requirements.</p>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    
    <h4>Examples of consent wording that make sharing data NOT possible (offending text in 
    <span class="offending">red</span>):</h4>
    <ul class="concise">
      <li>The records of this study <span class="offending">will be kept private</span> and confidential to the extent permitted 
      by law.</li>
      <li>Research records will be stored securely and <span class="offending">only the researcher and team members will 
      have access to the records</span>.</li>
      <li><span class="offending">No other researchers will have access</span> to the data files.</li>
      <li><span class="offending">Only project team research staff</span> will view the collected data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Examples of consent wording that make sharing possible:</h4>
    <ul class="concise">
      <li>[specific to storage/sharing through DataShop] Your de-identified data may be stored 
      indefinitely in the DataShop repository at Carnegie Mellon University. Only registered users 
      of DataShop will have access to the data for analysis purposes.</li>
      <li>[more general but still allows for sharing through DataShop] By participating, you understand 
      and agree that the data and information gathered during this study may be used by [PI's home institution] 
      and published and/or disclosed by ABC U to others outside of ABC. However, no personally identifying 
      information will ever be mentioned in any such publication or dissemination of the research data and/or 
      results to other researchers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Examples of data collection types:</h4>
    <ul class="concise">
      <li>Not human subjects data&mdash;this is data that was not
      originally collected for research purposes; for example, an educational
      software company might have collected extensive student log files from
      their paying clients (schools or individual customers).</li>
      <li>Study data collected under an IRB where participant 
      consent (or parent consent for minor participants) was NOT required. An 
      example:
      <ul>
        <li>a school whole-classroom K-12 study where the study materials are deemed 
        (by the IRB) to be 'regular classroom learning activities' so no parent 
        consent was required.</li>
        <li>a college whole-classroom study where the study materials are deemed 
        (by the IRB) to be 'regular classroom learning activities', so no participant consent was required.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Study data collected under an IRB where participant consent
      (or parent consent for minor participants) WAS required. A few
      examples (this list not exhaustive):
      <ul>
        <li>a lab study conducted at a researcher's institution for
        which the participants (whether minors or adults) were actively
        recruited and were paid (money or gift card) for their participation;</li>
        <li>a study run at a K-12 school either during non-class time
        (free period, before or after school) or are pulled out of a particular
        class to participate; participants may or may not have been paid;
        participants (through their parents) were actively recruited.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
