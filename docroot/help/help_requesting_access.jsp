	<h2>Requesting Dataset Access</h2>
    <p>
        After creating a DataShop account, you will have access to all <a
            href="index.jsp?datasets=public">public datasets</a>. This allows you to explore the
        functionality of DataShop.
    </p>
    <p>
        To gain access to private datasets, visit the <a href="index.jsp?datasets=other">private
            datasets</a> page and click the <strong>Request Access</strong> button next to the name of the
        project you would like to access. In the dialog that appears, enter a brief reason for why you
        would like access. The request for access will be sent to the project's principal investigator
        and data provider (if one exists).
    </p>

    <p>
        The status of your request will be shown on the <a href="AccessRequests">Access Requests</a>
        page under the heading <strong>My Requests for Access</strong>. Any projects for which you have
        been given access will appear on the <strong>My Datasets</strong> page.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you don't hear back regarding your access request, you can either click the <strong>Request Access</strong>
        button again after 24 hours or contact the project's principal investigator outside of
        DataShop. Similarly, if your request has been denied, you can click the <strong>Request Access</strong> button
        to re-request access.
    </p>
