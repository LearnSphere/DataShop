<h2>Files</h2>

<p>From the Files tab, you can add or view the following types of files by clicking on the subtabs:</p>
<ul class="concise">
    <li>Papers</li>
    <li>External Analyses</li>
    <li>Files</li>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> To add or modify files for a dataset, your account needs to be given
    permission by the project principal investigator (and data provider, if one exists). If you
    don't have such access already, find the name of the project on the 
    <a href="index.jsp?datasets=other">private datasets</a> page and click
    <strong>Request Access</strong>. Be sure to select the "edit" access type ("edit access (view
    access plus the ability to edit dataset metadata and add files)"). The status of your request
    will be shown on the <strong>Access Requests</strong> page.
