<h2>External Tools</h2>
<p>The <a href="ExternalTools">External Tools</a> page lists free tools submitted by 
developers in the educational data mining and intelligent tutoring systems communities.</p>

<p>Have a tool you want to submit? Log into DataShop and click <strong>Add Tool</strong> on the 
External Tools page. You will be asked to request permission to add tools. After we notify you that
you have been granted access, click <strong>Add Tool</strong> again to create a page for a new tool. 
After creating the page, click <strong>Upload File</strong> to add files.</p>

<p>Note that many tools already have a homepage on the web, so you might need to visit 
the tool's homepage to download it.</p>
